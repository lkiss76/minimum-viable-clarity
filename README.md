# Minimum Viable Clarity (MVC)
## A Foundational Standard for Human–AI Collaboration

Minimum Viable Clarity (MVC) defines the minimum amount of precision and structure required for an AI system to correctly interpret human intent.  
This repository contains **version 1.0**, the initial public specification.

### Why MVC?
Most AI failures do not originate from the model, but from **ambiguous or incomplete intent specification**.  
MVC introduces a clear, formal baseline for:
- predictable human–AI collaboration  
- scalable delegation to AI agents  
- reducing iteration loops  
- preventing misaligned outputs  

### Formal Definition
The full specification is available in:  
**`docs/definition.md`**
