# Minimum Viable Clarity (MVC)
## A Foundational Standard for Human–AI Collaboration

Minimum Viable Clarity (MVC) defines the minimum amount of precision and structure required for an AI system to correctly interpret human intent.  
This repository contains **version 1.0**, the initial public specification.

### Why MVC?
Most AI failures do not originate from the model, but from **ambiguous or incomplete intent specification**.  
MVC introduces a clear, formal baseline for:
- predictable human–AI collaboration  
- scalable delegation to AI agents  
- reducing iteration loops  
- preventing misaligned outputs

### Relation to MVP
The conceptual inspiration for MVC originates from the logic of Minimum Viable Product (MVP). While MVP established the minimal conditions required for a product to progress reliably from idea to delivery, **MVC defines the minimal clarity required for an intention to progress reliably from thought to correctly aligned AI execution.**
As software development matured around MVP, AI-augmented work will mature around MVC: a standard that ensures ideas, intuitions, and objectives can be unambiguously interpreted and executed by AI systems.
